# Antheap
An application to retrieve data on entrepreneurs using the WL API.
The application writes the data to a database - a MySql database was created for the project using XAMP and PHPMyAdmin.

The second part of the application is used to modify the .SRT file.
It moves the subtitles from the .SRT file by 5 seconds and 880 milliseconds (00:00:05,880) forward

Cuts issues from the file that start at equal seconds after the shift and pastes them into a new file

Gives new numbering to the new subtitle numbers for both files
